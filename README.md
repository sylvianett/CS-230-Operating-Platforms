1. Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The client, The Gaming Room, is a fictional company that developed a multiplayer game called Draw It or Lose It for Android. They wanted to expand their game to other platforms including Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, and web browsers. The game required support for multiple game sessions, high-speed rendering of image assets, and seamless, secure communication across distributed systems.

2. What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did particularly well in breaking down technical concepts and making them accessible for a non-technical audience. I clearly explained platform comparisons, system requirements, and technical trade-offs. I also provided realistic and scalable recommendations tailored to the client’s growth plans.

3. What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

Working through the design document helped me visualize how everything connects—from the front-end client experience to server-side logic and backend storage. It made the coding phase feel less overwhelming because I had a roadmap. I understood what components were needed and how they should interact before writing a single line of code.

4. If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would revise the earlier Evaluation section from Project Two. Now that I have a better understanding of comparing operating systems, I would make the comparison more concise and visually structured—possibly using more clear headers or tables to highlight key differences and benefits.

5. How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I focused on designing a responsive, scalable application that delivers a consistent user experience across platforms. The user needs fast loading times, intuitive gameplay, and strong security. That influenced decisions like using cloud-based storage, REST APIs for communication, and mobile-friendly interfaces. Meeting user needs is crucial because it determines how usable and enjoyable the software is—which directly affects its success.

6. How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached the design with a structured, layered mindset—starting with platform requirements and then drilling down into memory, storage, and security. In the future, I would continue using stakeholder-focused strategies, system architecture planning, and platform-specific evaluations before development. Documenting everything early helps reduce risks and keeps everyone aligned.
